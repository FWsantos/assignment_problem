# Assignment Problem

Implementation of the Hungarian O(n^3) Algorithm in Python.
Linearization method for the quadratic problem.

## Prerequisites

- python >= 3.10
- poetry >= 1.7

## Install & Run

This is a poetry project. Poetry is used to install dependencies.
So far, tests are done by editing main.py.
The exec() function with parameter 0 tests the assing files and with any other parameter it tests the assingp files. The results are saved in the output.txt and output_big.txt files respectively.

```
git clone https://github.com/FWsantos/assignment_problem.git
cd assignment_problem
poetry shell
poetry install --no-root
python src/main.py
```

<!-- ## Files
- `hungarian_n3.py`: Contains the implementation of the Hungarian O(n^3) Algorithm in Python.
- `main.py`: This is the main file where the algorithm is executed. It imports the `hungarian_n3` module and calls the necessary functions to solve the assignment problem.
- `controller.py`: This file contains the execution flow (read data sets ant run algorithm function)
- `general.py`: This file contains general utility functions that are used by the algorithm and the test cases. -->

## Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/FWsantos/assignment_problem.git
   cd assignment_problem
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   poetry shell
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   poetry install --no-root
   ```
4. Run the algorithm:
`    python src/main.py
   `
